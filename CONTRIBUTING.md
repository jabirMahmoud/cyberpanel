# Contributing to CyberPanel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CyberPanel! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🌿 Branch Structure

CyberPanel uses a structured branching strategy to manage development and releases:

### **Branch Types**

1. **`stable`** - Production-ready stable branch
2. **`vX.X.X`** - Version-specific stable branch (e.g., `v2.4.3`)
3. **`vX.X.X-dev`** - Development branch for specific version (e.g., `v2.4.3-dev`)

## 🔄 Development Lifecycle

### **Development Process**

1. **Default Branch**: The latest `vX.X.X-dev` branch serves as the default (master) branch
2. **Contributions**: All contributors must push to the latest `vX.X.X-dev` branch
3. **Stability Check**: Once development is complete and believed to be stable, a new `vX.X.X` stable branch is created from the dev branch
4. **Merge Process**: The `vX.X.X` stable branch is then merged into the main `stable` branch
5. **New Development**: A new `vX.X.X-dev` branch is created and becomes the default branch
6. **Cleanup**: Old dev branches are deleted to save space

### **Important Rules**

- ✅ **DO**: Create pull requests only for the latest dev branch
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create pull requests for any other branches (stable, old dev branches, etc.)
- 🔄 **Development**: All development happens only in the latest dev branch
- 🗑️ **Cleanup**: Old dev branches are deleted after merging to stable

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.6+ (see supported versions in README.md)
- Django framework knowledge

   ```

2. **Add Upstream Remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/usmannasir/cyberpanel.git
   ```

3. **Create Development Branch**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(module): add new feature"
   ```

5. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash

   ```
   Then create a pull request on GitHub targeting the latest dev branch.

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Requirements**

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Maintain or improve test coverage

### **Running Tests**

```bash
# Run all tests
